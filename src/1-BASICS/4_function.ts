// class
//          Advantage                        Drawback
// - codeflow is enjoyable                  - functions/methods are dependant to the class (not friendly "testable")
// - data's flow control                    - you need to create ("NEW") a class for use functionnality, you should manage life cyycle.
// - hight performance garanted             - but you need to manage memory


// function
//          Advantage                        Drawback
// - Unit testing friendly                  - maybe lot of parameter then ?
// - re-usable everywere !                  - we are human so, we have small brain to memorize that function exist !

// function win lot of match against class, so use function 80% of case
// POO (class) is the old way to program, the modern way is functionnal (function)
