Sure, here's an example TypeScript exam question:

The scenario depicts a video game development company that has been tasked with creating a feature where the player earns experience points (XP) after completing different types of tasks. Below are the requirements for the XP calculation, which should be implemented in TypeScript:

    The XP earned for completing a task is based on the task type and its difficulty level.
    There are three task types: "combat", "exploration", and "collection".
    Each task has a difficulty level between 1 and 5.
    The XP calculation is as follows:
        For combat tasks, XP is equal to the square of the difficulty level times 10.
        For exploration tasks, XP is equal to the difficulty level times 15.
        For collection tasks, XP is equal to the difficulty level times 5.
    The function should take in two arguments: a string for the task type, and a number for the difficulty level.
    The function should return a number representing the XP earned.

You need to implement this feature as a TypeScript function named calculateXP that includes appropriate type annotations and error handling. The function should also be part of a Task class that has a constructor accepting task type and difficulty level as arguments.

Additionally, write a minimum of two tests for this function using a testing framework of your choice. The tests should cover at least two different input scenarios.

Good luck!
