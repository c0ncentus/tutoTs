Sure, here's an example TypeScript exam question:

Write a TypeScript function that takes in a string as an argument and returns a new string in reverse order. The function should be named reverseString and should include appropriate type annotations and error handling. If an empty string is passed into the function, it should return an empty string.

For example, if the input string is "hello", the function should return "olleh".

Additionally, write a minimum of two tests for this function using a testing framework of your choice. The tests should cover at least two different input scenarios.

Good luck!
